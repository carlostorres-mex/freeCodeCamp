                It's based on <code>ubuntu</code>
            </header>
            <p>The base of Linux Mint is ubuntu, although the developers
                strip down some features they don't like and try to make
                it more user friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the snap store has been disabled by default.

                It has been the most popular Linux distro for quite a while
            </header>
            <p>
                Although it is based on ubuntu, and ubuntu is a derivative of debian,
                Linux Mint is more popular among desktop users because of the ease of use
                it provides to its users.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's been on distro watch top 10 list for more than 15 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                And it's been the top distro in many Linux awards.

                There is a Debian derivative
            </header>
            <p>In recent years, Canonical, the enterprise that maintains Ubuntu, has been 
                surrounded by controversial decisions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Linux Mint developers have since distanced themselves from Canonical, and are aiming to
                replace Ubuntu's base to that of Debian.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of now, LMDE 5 has been released recently.
